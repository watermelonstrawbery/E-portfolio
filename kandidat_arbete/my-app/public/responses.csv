I want to have my basic needs med first before I do the school work. Even keeping in touch with people do oftentimes come before my studies.","I think I’m pretty good at staying committed to goals because I think about them often. Mostly my goals are to have a lifestyle that I enjoy and that is meaningful, and this leads me to not prioritise some things that are only fun like playing games or watching funny memes. By doing this, I’ve managed to balance my life and do everything that I want with my time.","I typically recharge by focusing a long time on one thing, whether it’s with people around me or not. But not in new social settings, in that case it would be with people I know well. It’s because then I don’t need to focus on doing the right thing, rather thinking about other things outside of myself.","A social event were I felt particularly drained was when I met several people in my class and they talked about culture that I didn’t know anything about, and politics but they voted for another party than I do. I felt drained because it made me self conscious and I had to think a lot about what was the right thing to say and then I didn’t say anything but that was weird too. So I couldn’t really do it right.","First I had to cool down because I felt unfairly treated, and after that I asked if we could take a walk and talk about it. Then we talked and then we got angry again and screamed a bit, and talked about how we both felt unfairly treated. We could then understand each other and the others feelings so we could resolve the conflict.",I usually only listen and don’t give too much advice. I just assume that the person mostly feels overwhelmed with emotions and after they have talked about it they can see the situation more objectively for themselves and start working towards the solution.,"I try to work with a process while still feeling the feelings of stress and uncertainty, because I don’t want to avoid feeling. Thinking, what can I do while I feel these feelings, rather than trying to resolve them. Because for me it’s often not feelings that can resolve themselves that easy and fast.",I feel negative feelings pretty often and then I usually like to work out or clean- activities where I don’t have to think too much. Or listen to music.
07/04/2025 19:12:42,98,111,85,95,48,18:53:00,"Ones which if they go wrong, there are no huge consequences. I want to feel comfortable trying new things. E.g. I love travelling and trying new hobbies or new work-ways.",I'm open to disscuss different perspectives on things. If I have an opinion and gain new knowledge that contradicts my opinions then I can change my mind after some consideration.,"I gather all my tasks, break them down into smaller tasks, distribute time and resources to each task and determine how I can achieve my goals. ","I'm good at staying committed to my goals. If I've started something, I will see that it gets done. For instance, I've needed to maintain good grades to go on exchange studies, which I fulfilled.","If I'm socially drained from a social event where I've interacted and spoken to many, then I would recharge by being alone. If I want energy from other people then I hang out with family or friends.",I went skiing with a group of people that I had never really interacted with before. It was super fun and I enjoyed getting to know them. I made new friends and felt energized after.,I calmed both parties down and gave them a chance to express themselves. I listened to both of their perspectives and mediated between them. I gave them my opinion as someone neutral to solve the conflict.,I listen to their worries and ask them if they would like comfort or advice. I give them optimistic perspectives on things and validate their feelings.,I get extra calm under pressure and stressful situations. I assess the situation calmly and try yo find realistic solutions. I do damage control and keep my optimisim high.,I process my feelings and try to understand why I have such feelings. I get to the bottom of it and then reflect and try to mitigate negative escalations. I don't try to push my feelings away.
10/04/2025 14:25:36,72,87,74,98,64,13:05:00,"Either new versions of stuff I already am used to, e.g. a new edition of a game, application, technology etc. Or experiences where I can try new activities that may be out of my comfort zone but allow me to do so in a controlled environment, e.g. travelling to foreign lands but with people I know.","Yes, while I have no specific example I am often open to changing my perspective on matters when I get more information on it. I also find it easy to change my ways given a better solution, e.g. rewriting a program given a more clear solution.","Other than getting a overview of what has to be done, I seldom create any convoluted plans.","Yes, I find it easy to stay disciplined and not let any challenges break my commitments. One such example could be difficulties in my studies, e.g. studying for exams that I felt hopeless about yet still made sure to study for as it could benefit me in a future reexam.","I find that both work for me, although in moderation. Some times I find it best to recharge by socialising with friends, especially when recharging from studies with like minded peers. Other times its easier to recharge by spending some time alone or with family as it allows to disconnect from everyday stress.","While I seldom find myself drained during a social event, the few times that I have were on parties where the majority were drinking while I chose to be sober. It made socializing more taxing since it was much harder to match the energy of drunk party-goers.","While I have no concrete example of a conflict, I know that my preferred method of handling conflicts is by communicating with the person in question, although in some cases if the reason of the conflict was dumb enough it can sometimes resolve itself by just giving it a day to cool down.","While I often find that I am useless at giving advice when someone needs support, I find that simply being there and letting them speak their mind or just vent their problems can help.",My preferred way of reacting is to talk with someone close to me that might help me in any way. Although when my stress becomes unbearable I often find myself distancing myself from others and not wanting to talk about it.,"While I am not especially prone to them, when I get negative emotions its often related to being stressed/nervous. I often handle them either by talking with someone I trust or by getting my mind of the source through socializing or entertainment."
10/04/2025 15:42:44,96,96,89,96,51,13:05:00,"The new experiences that excite me the most are the ones I have researched about and planned for. This is because I like to think I know myself and what experiences I generally will enjoy. Therefore, during planning I can imagine myself doing the experience and then get excited. When there are new experiences that I do not know how I will feel about them, I will 
 only feel excited about the possibility of liking it and adding it to my list of experiences but not be as excited for something I know I will like. I can though become more excited if the people around me are very excited, then I can believe them.  ","It depends on what the new information is and how strong my feelings or opinions about the topic is. If it something I really value then I can be more stubborn and not really change my mind, though if the majority of the information logically disproof's my opinion then I will change my mind. For example if I hear that someone I know has done something bad and there is proof of that then I can change my view of that person. ","I plan and prioritize tasks after what is most important/earliest. What is most important depends on my goals and what for, is it important for my own wellbeing or is it important for my family or is it important for my education and career goals. For smaller tasks then it is mostly about what comes first and fastest to complete, for example 2 home assignments (1 very easy and 1 more difficult) then I can choose the first home assignment to do first. ","I would say that I am good at staying committed to my long-term goals, this because when start commit to something then it generally is very important to me or something that I know is achievable. For example, one of my long-term goals is to become a good dancer and compete, this I know is possible with training and commitment and therefore I just need to have the self-discipline to continue. Another that is maybe a bit more abstract is more about my views on family and their importance, to have a good education and get a good career so I can take care of them. This I am very committed to but there is no telling what can happen, only to keep going forward and focus on improving myself and taking all opportunities that I can take. ",I typically recharge by both spending time by spending time with others and by being alone. I need time alone to be able to get some clarity and get space to relax/reflect on what I am feeling after for example a long day of studying or a long day of spending time with people. I can though always spend time with my mother so with her I don't really need to spend time alone to recharge. But recharge to be able to be social and have the energy to keep up to social conventions and energies. ,"A social event where I felt particularly drained was after the student reception when I had to keep my energy and ""excitement"" high for long days with people I am not friends with or people I do not know. This was tiring because I had to be social and laugh and ask question etc for long hours. A social event I felt energized is often during my social dance in my dance studio because it something I love doing and keep a lot of energy from. ","I had a conflict with someone that made a comment of one of my insecurities, something that hurt me. This I took up with firstly with my mom who took up it with that specific person because she was a person in my family. Then I chose to message her personally and explain that I do not appreciate the comments and she understood in the end. ",I respond by listening to their situation and trying to figure out in what way they best receive emotional support as some people want only someone to listen and a shoulder to cry on whilst others want someone who gives solution to their problems. I try to understand the situation and if I can help them somehow then I will give my help. ,"It depends on the situation and if there is a clear goal or way to lessen the stress. For example, when I worked in an exchange currency office there were sometimes time periods of high stress with a lot of costumers and the need to get the calculations and the correct amount of money exchanged. When faced then, I try to be as calm as possible and not panic and if I do something wrong then I will not blame myself and blame it on the stress. I try in the moments of no stress, improve my skill in the topic so that when it becomes stressed again I have better skills to handle it. If it is a situation of uncertainty I try to just think about day to day and how I can be as stable as necessary so that whatever outcomes come I can face them and adapt. Nothing is ever uncertain for too long so in the end somethings will become clear. ","I can be prone to negative emotions such as sadness or nervousness but not anger really. I am also one of those people that starts crying when I am really angry, though this is nothing I can control and is an automatic response that my body does. When I feel sad I try not to ignore it for too long, as I believe that storing sadness within you without letting it pass through you only makes it worse so when I get a chance to be alone or with someone I really trust I let it all out and cry. This makes it often better. When I am nervous I usually handle it by trying to distract myself from thinking of the situation that makes me nervous, though only if I have already done everything that I needed to do before it. For example if I have a presentation, the day before I will practice a few times but then mostly not think about it and do something that makes me happy. "
